## About

This project is as a result of the recruitment exercise at Clafiya. It's a laravel passport authentication api
that allows the user authenticate with their email and password.

The app was deployed to a digital ocean droplet and is served by an nginx server on ubuntu 20.04.
It requires `php ^8.0` to work properly.

### Api Documentation

Please find the api documentation at https://clafiya.kodnificent.xyz/docs. A default user has been created for testing the api.
Use `hello@example.com` as email and `password` as password to test the login endpoint.

Feel free to contact `mbamaravictor@gmail.com` if you have any questions.
